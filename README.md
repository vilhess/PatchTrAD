# PatchTrAD: A Transformer-Based Anomaly Detector Using Patch-Wise Reconstruction Error for Time Series

This repository contains the implementation of **PatchTrAD**, a Transformer-based anomaly detection model that leverages patch-wise reconstruction error for effective time series anomaly detection. The model is compatible with multiple datasets, including both univariate and multivariate time series.

## Architecture Overview 🧠

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Prepare the Datasets
To install the datasets, you can use the following command:
```bash
python dataset/preprocess.py
```
For the **SWaT** dataset, you need to claim the data from the [iTrust website](https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/itrust-labs_datasets/dataset_info/) and place it in the `data/swat` directory. Files needed: SWaT_Dataset_Normal_v1.xlsx, SWaT_Dataset_Attack_v0.xlsx

### 3. Run the Model

#### Run on All Datasets

```bash
chmod +x ./run_models.sh
./run_models.sh
```

#### Run on a Specific Dataset

```bash
python main.py dataset=<dataset_name>
```

Replace `<dataset_name>` with one of the following:

- `nyc_taxi`
- `ec2_request_latency_system_failure`
- `smd`
- `smap`
- `msl`
- `swat`

> 📁 **Note:** Dataset-specific hyperparameters are located in the configuration folder: `conf/dataset`.

After training, results are saved to:  
```bash
results/results.json
```
