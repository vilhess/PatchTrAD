# PatchTrAD: A Transformer-Based Anomaly Detector Using Patch-Wise Reconstruction Error for Time Series

This repository contains the implementation of **PatchTrAD**, a Transformer-based anomaly detection model that leverages patch-wise reconstruction error for effective time series anomaly detection. The model is compatible with multiple datasets, including both univariate and multivariate time series.

## Architecture Overview üß†
![Architecture](figures/patchtrad.png)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Prepare the Datasets
To install the datasets, you can use the following command:
```bash
python dataset/preprocess.py
```
For the **SWaT** dataset, you need to claim the data from the [iTrust website](https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/itrust-labs_datasets/dataset_info/) and place it in the `data/swat` directory. Files needed: SWaT_Dataset_Normal_v1.xlsx, SWaT_Dataset_Attack_v0.xlsx

### 3. Run the Model

#### Run on All Datasets

```bash
chmod +x ./run_models.sh
./run_models.sh
```

#### Run on a Specific Dataset

```bash
python main.py dataset=<dataset_name>
```

Replace `<dataset_name>` with one of the following:

- `nyc_taxi`
- `ec2_request_latency_system_failure`
- `smd`
- `smap`
- `msl`
- `swat`

> üìÅ **Note:** Dataset-specific hyperparameters are located in the configuration folder: `conf/dataset`.

After training, results are saved to:  
```bash
results/results.json
```

Note: Results may have changed since the time of writing. For the latest results, please refer to the `results` folder. Especially for NASA datasets where we changed the normalization method.
Considering other baselines, code implementations are available in the [DL4TSAD](https://github.com/vilhess/DL4TSAD) repository.

## PatchTrAD on a Raspberry Pi

This demo (Youtube short) shows PatchTrAD running locally on a Raspberry Pi for real-time anomaly detection on time series data. Observations are send every 0.05 seconds from a simulated sensor stream, and the model processes this data in real-time. The system uses a green LED to indicate normal behavior and switches to a red LED when an anomaly is detected.  
It highlights how lightweight PatchTrAD can be deployed efficiently on edge devices, enabling local and responsive monitoring without needing cloud infrastructure.

### Features:
- Real-time data streaming and inference
- Low resource usage
- LED indicator for anomaly detection
- Compatible with Raspberry Pi 3/4

### How it works:
1. The Pi receives time series data from a sensor or simulated stream.
2. PatchTrAD processes incoming data in a sliding window.
3. During normal behaviour, a green led is running. If an anomaly is detected, the system triggers a red LED.
4. All computation is done locally on the Pi.

> ‚ö° Ideal for IoT, predictive maintenance, and smart monitoring use cases.
